Home automation is becoming increasingly popular due to its ability to enhance convenience, security, and energy efficiency. One cost-effective and user-friendly way to implement home automation is by using the ESP8266 Wi-Fi module along with the Blynk app. This combination allows users to control their home lights and other devices remotely through a mobile app, making it an ideal DIY project for beginners.

## Parts Required
1. **NodeMCU 1.0:** A development board based on the ESP8266, providing Wi-Fi functionality.
2.**Mobile Phone**: To control the Blynk app.
3. **5V Relay:** A solid-state relay recommended for long-term reliability.
4. **3.3V - 5V Breadboard Power Supply:** To power the circuit.
5. **12V Power Supply:** To power the relay and other components.
6. **Connecting Wires, Jumper Wires, Heat Shrinks, Screwdrivers, and Basic Tools:** Essential for building the circuit.
